	<h2>Puchong in State <strong>Selangor</strong></h2>

	<p>The first settlers of the area were the Orang Asli community in a village known as Kampung Pulas. In 1900, heron <strong>(Malay: burung puchong)</strong> were aplenty in the area and were a staple for the Orang Asli.</p>

	<p>However, it is believed that the area was explored by immigrants from <em>Sumatra and Java.</em> At first, the people worked as fish mongers, rubber tappers and miners. Due to the booming tin mining industry, immigrants from China and India were also brought in.</p>
